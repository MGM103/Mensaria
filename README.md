# Mensaria

## Description

Mensaria aims to be a best in class wealth intelligence hub. I am building this application as I have found no existing solutions where one can view their entire fiscal portfolio which in this day and age will be composed of very different asset classses, such as stocks, crypto, realestate, precious metals, etc. Mensaria aims to solve this problem by providing realtime updates and advanced analytics for every sector of one's portfolio. I have coined this one stop shop for one's portfolio a 'wealth intelligence hub.' Mensaria was created to solve a problem I face and I hope it helps others.
